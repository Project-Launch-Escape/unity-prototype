# Unity Prototype

## About
This project is a basic technical demonstration/prototype of some of the Project Launch Escape functionality in Unity 6 with DOTS (6000.0.3f1).

## Scope
- some form of LOD terrain rendering
- one or a couple of celestial bodies
- basic orbital mechanics
- a couple of distinct parts that can be put together to make a rocket, e.g.:
  - a sphere as a capsule, a cube as a fuel tank, a cylinder as an engine
  - no textures
  - no fuel flow graph
- piloting a vessel into from the ground into the orbit of a celestial body

## Goals
The main goal of these prototype projects is to evaluate the capabilities of both engines and how comfortable we are working within them.

The resulting code will most likely simply be archived and not used for the real project, so there is no need to focus on writing everything in a robust and sustainable way.
